                                                <strong>Lumbini :</strong><br />
                                                <p>Lumbini, the birth place of Lord Buddha, is situated about 22 km. from Bhairahawa (Siddharthanagar), below the Churia range, 24 km. south from the foothills of the Himalayas, on the western bank of Telar river in Rupandehi district of Lumbini zone in Nepal. It is about 300 km. west of capital city Kathmandu. Kapilvastu, Rupandehi and Nawalparasi Terai districts of Lumbini Zone are around Lumbini, the birth place of Lord Buddha, which are fertile and densely populated.It is about 34 km. from Naugarh Railway Station on the North-Eastern Railway of India. Buddha, Known as the Lord of Asia, was born in Lumbini during the full moon day in the month of Baisakh in 623 BC. He was born under a sal (Shorea robusta) tree when Mayadevi was going to her maternal town on the occasion of delivery.</p>
                                                <p>Suttanipata has mentioned the earliest description of the birth of Buddha in Lumbini. After the birth of Buddha he took seven steps towards north and, looking in all directions, he declared that "I am the foremost of all creatures to cross the riddle of the ocean of the existence, this is my last birth and here after, I will not be born again". The site is spelt as Rummindei or Rupandei (beautiful lady), the perverted form of Rupa devi, the queen Anjana of the king of Devadaha which was situated to the east of Kapilvastu in ancient time. The site is called Lun- min and La-Fa-Ni by the Chinese pilgrims Fa- Hien and Hiuen- Tsiang respectively. In course of exploration of the ancient Buddhist sites General Cunningham has mentioned La-Fa-Ni is Sanskrit Lavani, a beautiful lady. In Buddhist literature it is known as Pradimokşa vana blessed with various trees and flowers, which is compared to the Chittalata grove of Indra's paradise in heaven. The earliest Pali text Suttanipata has mentioned that, "The wisdom- child, that Jewel so precious, which can not be matched, has been born at Lumbini, in the Sakya land for well being and joy in the world of men". A Muslim historian of India named Abul Fazal has called Mokta. It is also known as Paderiya (Parariya) where the Asokan pillar is located in the Nepalese Terai. The name of the site is spelt Lumminigame and Lumbini Vana in the Asokan pillar Edict still standing at the same place. Mukherji has also mentioned the name Rummin-dei in his report. In the Magadhi language, being used in the north-eastern pillar edicts in India and Nepal, 'la' is invariable substituted for 'ra'. The location of Lumbini is pointed out in the Buddhist literature, as well as, in the records of the Chinese pilgrims who visited India in the fifth and seventh centuries AD. As mentioned in Jataka story this sal garden was in joint possession of the Sakayas and Koliyas during the life time of Buddha. The Mahavamsa, a Ceylones chronicle, and Nidana katha have also located it between Kapilvastu and Devadaha. The sal garden was the place of recreation during the reign of the Sakayas and Koliyas. Buddha charita of Asvaghosa describes Lumbini as "gay like the garden of caitra ratha with trees of every kind. According to Fa- Hien it is located about 50 li east of Kapilvastu. Hiuen- Tsiang had also pointed out that it was about 80 or 90 li.(21.729 or 24.445 km.) north-east of arrow-well. It was linked through popular ‘Uttara path' to Kapilvastu, Ramagrama and other important cities during the Buddhist period. The present location of Lumbini, the exact birth place of Lord Buddha, is absolutely clear.</p>

                                                
                                                <strong>Pilgrimage of Lumbini :</strong><br />
                                                <p>The Buddhist texts Lalitavistar, Jatak Nidan katha, Divya vadana and Mahavamsa have stated Lumbini as the birth place of Lord Buddha. When Buddha was lying down on the death bed at the age of eighty in Kusinagar his disciples, monks and nuns surrounded him. On this occasion, he advised with feeling of holy reverence and awe, viz. the place where the Tathagata was born (Lumbini grove), the place where he had reached perfect enlightenment (Bodha-Gaya), the place where for the first time he had proclaimed the law (Deer park near Varaņasi), and the place of his final extinction (Kusinagar). Thus, Lumbini was declared as the sacred spot to the pilgrims and was visited by the scholars, nobles, Royalties and devotees from all over the world. According to Kundala Vadana of Divyavadana having led King Asoka into the Lumbini jungle, venerable Upagupta indicated with his right hand and said "Asmin Maharaja pradase bhagavan jatah", meaning 'Oh Great king! Here the Blessed one was born!" King Asoka made an offer of one hundred thousand gold coins and established the first cetiya or pagoda. In the next chapter Asoka vadana of Divyavadan we find the description of the site. In the Asokan pillar of Lumbini it is inscribed that "Here Bhagwan Sakyamuni was at the Lumbini village". It is translated by Fuhrer as to mean King Piyadasi beloved of the Gods (or dear to the Gods), having been anointed 20 years came himself and worshipped saying: "Here Buddha Sakyamuni was born", and he got a stone (capital) representing a horse, and the stone pillar erected. Because here the worshipped one was born, the village of Lumbini has been made free of taxes and a recipient of wealth. According to Hultzsch it mean, ‘when king, beloved of gods, had been anointed twenty years he came himself and worshipped (this spot).’ Here Buddha Sakyamuni was born. He got a stone bearing horse made at this place. Hiuen-Tsiang's remark that the capital of the pillar contained a horse figure confirms to this interpretation. "As quoted by Rhys Davids , Buhler also says that "a stone horse was made and put on a stone pillar”. King Aśoka installed the stone column with a clear legend inscribed on it that it is the spot of Lumbini where the Blessed one was born. In Lumbini a brick railing was erected at a distance of 48.76 cm. from the base of the pillar and it had dentils also. After the visit of Emperor, many monks and nuns had started visiting the place. A large number of monasteries and vihars must have been built for their stay in this sacred complex. A large number of artifacts of the Mauryan, Sunga, Kushaņa and Gupta periods were recovered in course of various excavations. It is thus clear that it continued to be a place of pilgrimage since the third century BC till today.</p>
                                                <p>Chinese pilgrims have given a more accurate and authentic description of Lumbini. Shui-Ching-Chu describes that at Lumbini the Asokan tree which was gripped by Mayadevi at the time of Siddhartha's birth was still in a living condition and an image of Mayadevi was placed there where devotees used to offer puja articles. The spot where Siddhartha's feet touched the earth first, Aśoka got the Siddhartha's foot prints shielded with stones. His description has been ratified by the noticeable findings discovered during the joint excavation of the Department of Archaeology, Lumbini Development Trust and Japanese Buddhist Federation from 1993 to 1997. It is clearly seen that Aśoka had shielded the Siddhartha's footprints with stones in order to secure it. This significant news of the findings of the excavation was publicly declared by then Honorable Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba on February 4, 1996. According to Fa-Hien in Lumbini the queen (Mayadevi) having entered the pool to bathe, came out on the north side , and after walking twenty paces, raised her hands and grasped the branch of a tree. She brought forth the Heir Apparent facing to the east. On reaching the ground, the Heir Apparent walked seven steps, and two dragon- kings washed his body. At the time of washing the tank was used. In this context Hiuen-Tsiang had stated that there was the bathing tank of the Śakyas, the water of which was clear as a mirror and the surface of which was covered with a mixture of flowers. 24 or 25 paces to the north of this there was fallen Asokan flower tree on the birth place of Bodhisattva. To the east from this place there was a Stupa built by Aśoka-raja on the spot where the two dragons bathed the body of the prince. Bodhisattva walked without assistance in the direction of the four quarters, seven spaces in each direction, and said, "I am the only Lord in heaven and earth; from this time forth my births are finished". To the east of this stūpa were two fountains of pure water, by the side of which two stūpas were built. To the south of this was a stūpa, where Sakra, the Lord of Devas, received Bodhisattva in his arms. Close to the site there were four stūpas to denote the place where the four heavenly kings received Bodhisattva in their arms. When Bodhisattva was born they wrapped him in a golden coloured cotton vestment, and brought him to his mother, and placed him on a golden slab (bench). They said," The queen may rejoice indeed at having given birth to such a fortunate child!". If the Devas rejoiced at the event how much more could the men. By the side of these stūpas there is a great stone pillar, on the top of which was the figure of a horse built by Aśoka. It was broken off in the middle and fell to the ground due to the contrivance (thunder stroke) of a wicked dragon. By the side of it is a little oil river flowing to the south-east, where Mayadevĩ had brought forth her child to wash and to purify herself. After Hiuen-Tsiang many other pilgrims had visited this place from time to time. One of them was Wu-Kung who came in 764 AD. Due to the absence of records very little is known about the condition of the area. The monumental and habitational structures, stone sculptures, terracotta human and animal figurines, fragments of pottery belonging to the Mauryan, Suńga, Kushaņa, Gupta, Vardhan and Sena-Pala periods, found here prove that Lumbini was well-populated till the early-medieval period and was frequently visited by the monks, nuns and other devotees from time to time. The names of Jitari Malla ( 1287-89 AD) and Ripu Malla (1312 AD) were engraved on the stone columns (pillars) at Nigalihawa and Lumbini garden. It consists of the words, "Om mani padme hum, shree Ripumallaschiran jayatu, 1234". The former portion is a Mahayani Buddhist prayer and the later portion means " prince Ripu Malla, be victorious for long 1234". The year 1234 in the Saka era, corresponding to 1312 AD. Bhuwan Lal Pradhan has claimed that Sikandar Lodi (1489-1517 AD) and Aurangzeb (1668-1707AD) were mainly responsible for the destruction of cultural heritage and property of the Lumbini- Kapilvastu region. During the reign of Mukunda Sena I (1540-1575 AD), Mukunda Sena II (1750-82 AD) and Mahadatta Sena (1782- 93 AD) in Palpa the previous religious condition in the region could not be retained. The site was lost in the dense forest until the discovery of General Raņa, Governor of Palpa.</p>

                                                <strong>Culture, Temples and festivals :</strong>
                                                <p>The centre of Janakpur is dominated by the impressive Janaki Mandir to the north and west of the bazaar. This temple, one of the biggest in Nepal, was built in 1898 (1955 in the Nepali calendar) by Queen Brisabhanu Kunwar of Tikamgarh.[5] It is also called "Nau Lakha Mandir" after the cost of construction, said to be nine (nau) lakh. The oldest temple in Janakpur is Ram Mandir, built by the Gurkhalisoldier Amar Singh Thapa.[5] Pilgrims also visit the more than 200 sacred ponds in the city for ritual baths. The two most important, Dhanush Sagar and Ganga Sagar, are located close to the city centre. The Vivah Mandap temple where Lord Rama and Sita are said to have been married. It is situated next to the Janki Mandir.</p>
                                                <p>Major religious celebrations include the major Hindu festivals such as Deepawali, and Vijayadashami.[5] followed by spectacular Chhath Puja (sun worship) six days after Deepawali. Both the festivals Deepawali and Chhath are heavily celebrated with a carnival-like atmosphere. The locals take pride in the way these festivals are celebrated.</p>
                                                <p>On the full moon day of February/March before the festival of Holi, a one-day Parikrama (circumambulation) of the city is celebrated. Many people offer prostrated obeisances along the entire eight km route. Two other festivals honor Rama and Sita: Rama Navami, the birthday of Lord Rama, in March–April, draws thousands of pilgrims.[6] And the Vivaha Panchami or Vivaha festival re-enacts the wedding of Rama and Sita at the famous Vivah Mandap temple on the fifth day of the waxing moon in November or early December(after Kartik Purnima),where Rama broke the bow of Shiva.</p>
                                                <p>Pilgrims stay in one of the city's five good hotels or small guest houses. There are also five fully equipped dharmashalas (cheap lodgings for pilgrims).</p>

At the last stage of his life, Gautam Buddha had advised to his disciplines that they should visit at these sites, associated with him. Master plan is also based on Buddhist philosophy. Plan is divided into three parts on the basis of worldly- life (grihastha), cultural complex, study area, religious sector and ruins of human civilization from north to south respectively.</p>
